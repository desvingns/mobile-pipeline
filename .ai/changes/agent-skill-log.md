## 2026-05-25T00:00-baseline
type: add
target: .ai/
summary: established the dual-tool coordination layer — .ai/ workspace, canonical AGENTS.md, thin CLAUDE.md, and the Codex action-plan brief
reason: make cmp drivable by both Claude Code and Codex CLI (see .ai/tasks/codex-001-dual-tool.md)

## 2026-05-28T12:00-instrumented-runner
type: add
target: templates/android/agents/{{PREFIX}}-runner-instrumented-android.md
summary: new Android agent that runs ONE connectedDebugAndroidTest class on a connected device and returns parsed pass/fail JSON (device suite, not JVM)
reason: the existing runner is JVM-only; on-device Compose-UI coverage had no runner
affects: claude, codex

## 2026-05-28T12:01-device-workflow
type: add
target: templates/common/commands/{{PREFIX}}.md
summary: new --device <screen|scope> workflow (Android) — mandatory device-connection gate (ask user + record to memo if missing/lost), write ONE instrumented test, run via the instrumented runner; plus two Rules bullets
reason: give a less-capable model an on-rails one-test-at-a-time on-device loop
affects: claude, codex

## 2026-05-28T12:02-device-connection-memo
type: add
target: templates/android/memory/device-connection.md.tmpl
summary: new memory template recording the verified device/emulator connection; holds the mandatory/ask/update-if-lost rule
reason: stop re-asking how the test device is connected; make a connected device a hard precondition

## 2026-05-28T12:03-device-seam-policy
type: update
target: templates/android/agents/{{PREFIX}}-tester-android.md, templates/android/agents/{{PREFIX}}-developer-android.md, templates/common/agents/{{PREFIX}}-reviewer-base.md
summary: device-test seam policy — tester gets an instrumented-compose-ui test type; developer may add only testTag/contentDescription/public seams; reviewer Check 7 blocks behaviour beyond a declared seam
reason: prevent a weaker model from inventing UI/events under the guise of a test seam
