# `.claude/specs/` — SPEC backlog board + brainstorm artifacts

This directory is a lightweight, **file-based task board for SPECs**, plus the home of
`/{{PREFIX}} --discuss` brainstorm records. It exists so a feature that is **too large for one
SPEC** is stored, ordered, and resumable across sessions — instead of living only in one chat.

**Committed to git** — long-term visibility into what we planned and why. A backlog SPEC that
went nowhere is still useful evidence of considered trade-offs.

## Layout

```
.claude/specs/
  README.md      # this contract
  backlog/       # SPECs queued, not started (+ an optional <epic>-00-overview.md)
  active/        # the SPEC(s) currently being implemented — normally exactly one
  done/          # shipped SPECs, with commit + changed files filled in
  <slug>.md      # (root) --discuss brainstorm artifacts
```

A SPEC's **status is the folder it lives in** (`backlog` / `active` / `done`). Moving the file
between folders is how its status changes — there is no separate state store.

## When the board is used

- `/{{PREFIX}} --feature <large feature>` — if Phase 1 finds the feature splits into **≥2
  independently-shippable SPECs**, the orchestrator writes each SPEC as a file in `backlog/`
  (behind one y/N gate), then promotes the first to `active/` and implements it. The rest wait
  in `backlog/` for the next run.
- `/{{PREFIX}} --spec <description>` — **author SPEC(s) only** and write them straight to `backlog/`
  (`Status: draft`, no approval gate). The way to fill the backlog without implementing.
- `/{{PREFIX}} --feature --next` (or `--backlog <slug>`) — **implement a SPEC already in the
  backlog**: it is treated as already created + approved, so Phase 0/1 are skipped — the file moves
  `backlog/ → active/` and goes straight to implementation, then to `done/`.
- A single-SPEC feature skips the board — the SPEC is shown inline in chat as before.
- `/{{PREFIX}} --discuss <topic>` — still writes a single `<slug>.md` brainstorm artifact at the
  root (format at the bottom). When a brainstorm graduates into a multi-SPEC plan, those SPECs go
  to `backlog/`.

## Naming (epics)

Group the SPECs of one large feature ("epic") by a shared filename prefix + an order number:

```
backlog/<epic-slug>-00-overview.md   # epic index: goal, ordered SPEC list, dependencies, cross-cutting notes
backlog/<epic-slug>-01-<short>.md    # SPEC 1
backlog/<epic-slug>-02-<short>.md    # SPEC 2
...
```

A standalone (non-epic) SPEC is just `<slug>.md` in the relevant folder.

## SPEC file format

```markdown
# <SPEC title>
Epic: <epic-slug | —>
Order: <NN of MM | —>
Status: draft | backlog | active | done   # draft = auto-written by --spec (unreviewed); else mirrors the folder
Depends-on: <epic-NN | —>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## SPEC
=== SPEC ===
<the full SPEC block — TASK / WHAT / LAYERS / CHANGED_HINT / TEST_TYPES / CONSTRAINTS>
=== END SPEC ===

## Gap / context
<one or two lines: the concrete gap this SPEC closes>

## Implementation links
- commit: <hash>      (filled when moved to done/)
- files:  <changed files>
```

## Lifecycle

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| `--spec <desc>` | write SPEC file(s) to `backlog/` with `Status: draft` — no approval gate (grooming) |
| `--feature <desc>` splits into ≥2 SPECs | write SPEC files into `backlog/` (+ overview) behind one y/N gate, promote the first |
| `--feature --next` / `--backlog <slug>` | take a backlog SPEC (already approved) → move `backlog/ → active/`, `Status: active`, run Phase 2 — Phase 0/1 skipped |
| SPEC shipped (Verifier pass / push) | move `active/ → done/`, fill `commit` + `files`, set `Status: done` |

Moving a SPEC to `active/` never bypasses the human SPEC-approval gate — Phase 2 still waits for
the user's `y` before any agent runs.

## `--discuss` brainstorm artifact format (root-level `<slug>.md`)

```markdown
# <Topic, one-line restatement>
Status: brainstorm | spec-ready | in-progress | done
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Brainstorm output
<full BRAINSTORM block from {{PREFIX}}-architect — verbatim>

## Approved SPEC
<full SPEC block from /{{PREFIX}} --feature, or "(pending)">

## Implementation links

- files: <list>
(or "(pending)")
