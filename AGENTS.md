# AGENTS.md — working on `claude-mobile-pipeline`

Canonical instructions for any AI tool working **on this repository**. Read by Codex CLI
natively; imported by `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code via `@AGENTS.md`. This is the single source
of truth — do not duplicate these rules elsewhere.

## What this repo is

`claude-mobile-pipeline` (cmp) is a **generator**, not an app. `bootstrap.sh` renders the
`templates/` tree + a user-chosen `PREFIX` into a ready-to-use agent pipeline for a mobile
project (Android / iOS): specialist agents, an orchestrator command, deterministic bash
scripts, and cross-session memory. The thing we edit here is the *template system*, not a
running application.

## Golden rules (invariants — do not break)

1. **Cross-platform Bash only.** Every shell script must run on Linux, macOS, and Windows Git
   Bash. Never use PowerShell in pipeline scripts. Shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
2. **Never `sed -i`.** GNU and BSD `sed` differ. Always write to a temp file and `mv` (see
   `lib/render.sh`). This is the most common portability bug — respect it.
3. **Markdown-first.** Agents, memory, handoff, and the change-log are all plain markdown so
   any tool can read/write them without a custom parser. Keep it that way.
4. **Placeholders.** `{{KEY}}` tokens in file *content* and `{{PREFIX}}` in file *names* are
   substituted by `bootstrap.sh`. Content is rendered before filenames are renamed. New
   placeholders must be added to the vars file in `bootstrap.sh`.
5. **Conditional blocks.** `<!-- platform:X -->…<!-- /platform:X -->` and
   `<!-- if COND -->…<!-- /if -->` are trimmed by `lib/render.sh`. Author **at most one inline
   block per line** (the inline `sed` pass is greedy). The new `tool:` axis (below) follows the
   same rules.
6. **Memory is append-only.** Generated memory files are never overwritten by bootstrap; the
   `.ai/memory/` here is durable knowledge, extended not rewritten.
7. **Structured payloads.** Pipeline agents return exactly one structured payload (JSON or a
   BRAINSTORM block) — no prose around it. Deterministic scripts emit exactly one JSON line.
8. **SemVer.** PATCH = wording/typos; MINOR = new agents / optional sections (additive);
   MAJOR = renames or JSON-shape changes. Bump `VERSION` + `CHANGELOG.md` for any release.

## Dual-tool model (the core design)

cmp is driven by **both Claude Code and Codex CLI**, at two levels — (A) we co-develop this
repo with both tools; (B) `bootstrap.sh` emits config for both into generated projects.

Pattern: **one canonical source + thin per-tool adapters.**

- **`AGENTS.md` is canonical**; `CLAUDE.md` is a thin `@AGENTS.md` import + Claude-only notes.
- Agent / orchestrator prose stays **tool-neutral**. The few genuinely tool-specific lines are
  isolated behind `<!-- tool:claude -->…<!-- /tool:claude -->` and
  `<!-- tool:codex -->…<!-- /tool:codex -->` markers — the same engine that handles
  `platform:`. Claude bootstraps keep the `claude` branch; Codex keeps the `codex` branch.
- **`{{AGENT_DIR}}`** resolves to `.claude` or `.codex` so paths like
  `{{AGENT_DIR}}/scripts/...` work for either tool.
- The Codex adapters (`AGENTS.md`, `.codex/`) in a generated project are **derived** from the
  canonical agent specs by `lib/sync.sh` — never hand-maintained twice.

Why this way (industry best practice): see `.ai/memory/dual-tool-architecture.md`.

## The `.ai/` workspace + coordination protocol

All cross-tool coordination lives in `.ai/` (git-tracked). Read `.ai/README.md` for the full
protocol. In short, **every session**:

1. **Start** — read this file → `.ai/handoff.md` → `.ai/memory/MEMORY.md` → open `.ai/tasks/*`.
2. **During** — keep your task file's `STATUS` current; log each agent/skill/template edit in
   `.ai/changes/agent-skill-log.md` (format: `.ai/changes/README.md`).
3. **Hand-off / end** — rewrite `.ai/handoff.md` (DONE / DECISIONS / NEXT / OWNER / BLOCKERS)
   and commit it with your work. Transport between tools is git: commit, and the other tool
   sees it on its next run. Do not touch files another tool lists under IN PROGRESS.

## Change-log + incremental sync

When you improve an agent or skill, record it **once** as an append-only entry in
`.ai/changes/agent-skill-log.md`. A sync then reads only entries newer than the per-adapter
cursor in `.ai/changes/sync-state.json` — never the whole system. `lib/sync.sh` is the
consumer/propagator and the only writer of the cursor. See `.ai/memory/change-log-discipline.md`.

## How to work & verify

- Understand a change end-to-end before editing — trace it through `bootstrap.sh` (copy →
  render → strip → rename phases) and `lib/render.sh`.
- **Dry run:** `./bootstrap.sh --dry-run --platform=android --prefix=ft --project-name=Demo
  --package=com.demo.app` shows planned outputs without writing.
- **Lint:** `bash -n <script>` and `shellcheck` must be clean for any touched `.sh`.
- **Smoke test:** bootstrap into a throwaway dir, then grep the output to confirm no
  `<!-- platform:* -->` / `<!-- tool:* -->` / `{{...}}` markers leaked into rendered files.
- Don't break back-compat: a `claude`-only bootstrap must produce the same `.claude/` output as
  before the dual-tool work.

## Ownership while building the dual-tool support

To avoid collisions, work is split by file ownership; the seams are pinned in
`.ai/tasks/codex-001-dual-tool.md` (the authoritative contract for the shared interfaces).

- **Codex owns:** `lib/render.sh` (the `tool:` axis), `lib/sync.sh` (new), `bootstrap.sh`
  (`--tools`, `{{AGENT_DIR}}`, adapter-emission phase), the `.codex/` config + prompt templates,
  and verifying the bash scripts are path-neutral.
- **Claude owns:** the canonical `AGENTS.md` prose, the `tool:` branches inside agent /
  orchestrator templates, the `.ai/` scaffold + protocol + schemas, and the docs / version bump.

**Shared seams (agreed, do not change unilaterally):** the `{{AGENT_DIR}}` name; the
`<!-- tool:claude|codex -->` marker syntax + semantics; the change-log entry format and
`sync-state.json` shape; and the `lib/sync.sh` input/output contract. All four are specified in
`.ai/tasks/codex-001-dual-tool.md`.
